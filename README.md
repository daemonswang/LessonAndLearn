# LessonAndLearn
12 year passed since I worked as a software engineer, so many interesting and unforgetable thing are still remomberable. Now it is the right time 
to stop then look back, some of are the in person experience and some of are the thoughts, hopefully it will do some benifits for the reader.

# Education
I majored in `software engineering`, more than 10 year passed since graduate, for now still miss the university days (incl. wonderful food, beautiful age, passion, etc.), something want to highlight in order have a more bright future:

## Theory and practice are all important!!! Not one more over then another!!!
Computer science is a very practical related major, there would be different approaches for the specific problem, which depends on the person, 
the faced conditions, even from the time schedule. However under the same conditions, there must be a dedicate solution is the most reasonable
and elegant, that should be result of balance between the metrics.

- **Theory** or **Principle**: idealy they are applied to a very specific condition sets (i.e.: all are obvious and on the table), any condition 
mismatch, then not applized anymore
- **Practical**: in the real world, it is much more complicated scene, so many dependecies and preconditions (i.e.: the dependencies and preconditions
sometime is not easy to be figured out, or more precisely to say very diffcult) are involved, I bet no out of box solution on hands
- **Approach**: when you want to get a dedicated destination, so many roads
- **Balance**: the criteria matters

## Be in diversity
University is a idealy world, no money worries, no needs to support the family, apart from learning the proffesional sourses, large mount of free time
could be for interesting, funny, sporting. However it will not be the case when start working, most likely when you on board a company, you will be responsible
a dedicated work, although you can also free up some partial times for learning, have to say it could be in pieces (e.g. break by children's teaching).
So suggest the school people, enjoy the days also experience and learn different knowledge as much as possible.

# On job
Have to say: `more deeply and comprehensive understanding about the knowledge were built among this phase`, this also could be explained by `combined together
theory and practical is the most powerful mindset`.

Next I will separate the different session to go over some of the ideas regarding my on job lesson and learns...

To be honest I am very enjoy my coding and debugging career.
